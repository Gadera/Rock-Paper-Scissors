# Rock-Paper-Scissors
 This code runs the game of rock, paper, scissors in a command line
 You will need to download the code then run it in a python shell 
 some of it's components include;
 1. list of possible options, initialized. e.g R for rock, P for paper and S for scissors
 2. when input is invalid, it prints "Error, enter valid input"
 3. the program is in a loop hence, you can decide to play again by typing "yes" or end the game by tying "no"
 4. if it's a tie, the program gives you an option of playing again.
